## Introduction

### Welcome to the 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge!

With many of us around the world being encouraged to stay indoors and work from home, this is the perfect opportunity for you to focus on studying up for future code interviews. In order to help you stay focused, LeetCode is running the 30-Day LeetCoding Challenge for the month of April. A problem will appear here at midnight PDT each day, and you'll have 24 hours to solve it and submit it here on the Explore Card.
